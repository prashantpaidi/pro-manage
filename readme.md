## Project Structure

The project is structured into two main parts: the backend and the frontend.

### Backend

Located in the `backend` directory, the backend handles API requests and database interactions.

*   **`package.json`**: Lists the project's dependencies.
*   **`controllers/`**: Contains controllers for handling user and task-related requests.
    *   `taskController.js`: Handles operations for tasks (create, read, update, delete, analytics).
    *   `userController.js`: Manages user authentication (register, login, update profile).
*   **`middleware/`**: Includes middleware functions.
    *   `authMiddleware.js`: Verifies authentication tokens.
*  **`models/`**: Contains database models.
    * `Task.js` defines schema of the task
    * `User.js` defines schema of the User
*   **`routes/`**: Defines API routes.

## API Endpoints

The following endpoints are available in the backend:

### User Routes (`/users`)

*   **`POST /users/register`**: Registers a new user.
*   **`POST /users/login`**: Logs in an existing user.
*  **`PUT /users/:userId`**: Updates the user name and password.

### Task Routes (`/tasks`)

*   **`GET /tasks/user/:userId`**: Gets all tasks for a specific user. Requires authorization.
*   **`GET /tasks/:id`**: Gets a single task by ID.
*   **`POST /tasks`**: Creates a new task. Requires authorization.
*   **`PUT /tasks/:id`**: Updates a task by ID. Requires authorization.
*   **`DELETE /tasks/:id`**: Deletes a task by ID. Requires authorization.
*   **`GET /tasks/analytics/:userId`**: Gets analytics data for a userâ€™s tasks. Requires authorization.
*   **`GET /tasks/grouped/user/:userId`**: Gets all tasks for a specific user grouped by task type. Requires authorization.

## Environment Variables

Create `.env` files in both `backend` and `frontend` folders:

### Backend (`backend/.env`)

*   **`PORT`**: Port number to run the server on (e.g., `3000`).
*   **`MONGODB_URL`**: Connection string to MongoDB (e.g., `mongodb://localhost:27017/pro_manage`).
*   **`JWT_SECRET`**: Secret key used for JSON Web Token signing.

### Frontend (`frontend/.env`)

*  **`VITE_APP_API_URL`**: URL of the backend API server (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`).

## Running the Application

1.  **Start the backend server:**
    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm start
    ```

2.  **Start the frontend development server:**

    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm run dev
    ```
    The frontend will typically be accessible at `http://localhost:5173`.
